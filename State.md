Context can request  each instance of different concrete states to do something(e.g ConcreteStateA.getsomething) and return these result to the client

## Example 

Design A gumball machine without state pattern [SourceCode](https://github.com/bethrobson/Head-First-Design-Patterns/blob/master/src/headfirst/designpatterns/state/gumball/GumballMachine.java)
```java=

public class GumballMachine {
    // define 4 states of Gumball Machine
    final static int SOLD_OUT = 0;
    final static int NO_QUARTER = 1;
    final static int HAS_QUARTER = 2;
    final static int SOLD = 3;

    int state = SOLD_OUT;
    int count = 0;

    public GumballMachine(int count) {
        this.count = count;
        if (count > 0) {
            state = NO_QUARTER;
        }
    }

    // so each action would all content 4 states
    //     HAS_QUARTER, NO_QUARTER, SOLD_OUT AND SOLD
    public void insertQuarter() 
    {
        if (state == HAS_QUARTER) {
            //..
        } else if (state == NO_QUARTER) {
            //..
        } else if (state == SOLD_OUT) {
            //..
        } else if (state == SOLD) {
            //..
        }
    }

        public void ejectQuarter() {
            //..
        }
        public void turnCrank() {
            //..
        }
        private void dispense() {
            //..
        }
```
> If we are going to add a new function for gumball machine such as adding 10% of the time the sold state leads to two ball being release.
>> Adding a new state which means each action (methods) in class GumballMachine should handle a new state, this means there will be a lot of code to modify 


## A Gumball machine With State pattern 



```java=
/* State
 * file name : State.java 
 */
public interface State {
 
	public void insertQuarter();
	public void ejectQuarter();
	public void turnCrank();
	public void dispense();
    
	public void refill();
}
/* Concrete States
 Each state implements interface State 
 and override every actions(methods)
 */
public class SoldoutState implements State{
    //...
}
public class SoldState implements State {
    //..
}
public class NoQuarterState implements State{
    //..
}
public class HasQuarterState implements State{
    //..
}

```

And now if we want to add a new state,thanks for State pattern,we can simply create a new file (for example `WinnerState.java`) and implement from State.class
```java=
public class WinnerState implement Sate{
    //...
}
```

Finally we can create Context GumballMachine.java
```java=
public class GumballMachine {
 
	State soldOutState;
	State noQuarterState;
	State hasQuarterState;
	State soldState;
	State winnerState;
 
    // by default
	State state = soldOutState;
	int count = 0;
 
    // constructor
	public GumballMachine(int numberGumballs) {
		soldOutState = new SoldOutState(this);
		noQuarterState = new NoQuarterState(this);
		hasQuarterState = new HasQuarterState(this);
		soldState = new SoldState(this);
		winnerState = new WinnerState(this);

		this.count = numberGumballs;
 		if (numberGumballs > 0) {
        // default current state as 
        //     No Quarter inserted right now
			state = noQuarterState;
		} 
	}

	public void insertQuarter() {
		state.insertQuarter();
	}
 
	public void ejectQuarter() {
		state.ejectQuarter();
	}
 
	public void turnCrank() {
		state.turnCrank();
		state.dispense();
	}

	void setState(State state) {
		this.state = state;
	}
 
	void releaseBall() {
		System.out.println("A gumball comes rolling out the slot...");
		if (count > 0) {
			count = count - 1;
		}
	}
    // get gums
	int getCount() {
		return count;
	}
 
    // add the gums (count)
	void refill(int count) {
		this.count += count;
		System.out.println("The gumball machine was just refilled; its new count is: " + this.count);
		state.refill();
	}

    public State getState() {
        return state;
    }

    public State getSoldOutState() {
        return soldOutState;
    }

    public State getNoQuarterState() {
        return noQuarterState;
    }

    public State getHasQuarterState() {
        return hasQuarterState;
    }

    public State getSoldState() {
        return soldState;
    }

    public State getWinnerState() {
        return winnerState;
    }
}
```
Now Run our Gumball machine
```java=
public class GumballMachineTestDrive
{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // A gumball Machine contents 10 gums 
        GumballMachine gumballMachine = new GumballMachine(10);
        
        // Now you
        // 1. insert a coin
        // 2. turn Crank
        // 3. insert a coin agian
        // 4. turn Crank
        gumballMachine.insertQuarter();
        gumballMachine.turnCrank();
        gumballMachine.insertQuarter();
        gumballMachine.turnCrank();
}
```

## Using of State and Strategy 

### Strategy 
In general, think of the Strategy Pattern as a flexible alternative to sub-classes; 
If you use inheritance to define the behavior of a class, then youâ€™re stuck with that behavior even if you need to change it.
With Strategy you can change the behavior by composing with a different object.

### State 
Think of the State Pattern as an alternative to putting lots of conditionals in your context; by encapsulating the behaviors within state objects, you can simply change the state object in context to change its behavior.
